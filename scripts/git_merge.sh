# git_merge.sh — guard `gh pr merge` against the `round_unpushed`
# trap.
#
# `doc/workflow.md`'s state machine has no direct edge from
# `round_unpushed` to `merged`, and no edge from an unfinalized PR head
# to `merged`. Review fixups are allowed to reach GitHub during the
# review loop, but they must be autosquashed before merge.
#
# This script is the local-side enforcement: it resolves the PR's head
# branch (via `gh pr view`, *not* the currently-checked-out branch —
# git_merge.sh 17 might be invoked from main), refreshes the remote
# head, then refuses to invoke `gh pr merge` if that PR's local branch
# is ahead of its remote tracking ref or if the remote head still
# contains autosquashable commits. Re-run after push/finalization.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/git_merge.sh [<gh-pr-merge-args...>]
#
# Examples:
#   scripts/git_merge.sh 17                      # interactive
#   scripts/git_merge.sh 17 --rebase --delete-branch
#   scripts/git_merge.sh --rebase                # current branch's open PR
#
# All arguments are forwarded verbatim to `gh pr merge` after the
# guard passes.

Resolves the PR's head branch via `gh pr view`, then refuses to run
if that local branch is ahead of its remote tracking ref or if the PR
head still contains autosquashable commits. All arguments are forwarded
to `gh pr merge` once the guard passes.
