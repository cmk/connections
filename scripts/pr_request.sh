#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Prints the number that will be assigned to the *next* PR (or issue)
# opened in the current repo.
#
# GitHub uses a single sequence per repo for both issues and pull
# requests, so the next PR number is:
#
#     max(last_issue_number, last_pr_number) + 1
#
# The REST `issues` endpoint returns both issues and PRs (PRs are
# issues with a `pull_request` key), so `state=all` ordered by
# creation gives the current maximum in a single call.
#
# Used by the local review transition to name
# `doc/reviews/review-NNNNN.md` before the PR is opened. The prediction
# is usually final, but if another issue or PR is opened between the
# prediction and the PR being created, the number drifts and the review
# file has to be renamed to match the number GitHub actually assigned.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/pr_request.sh [owner/name]
#
# If `owner/name` is omitted, the repo is inferred via `gh repo view`.
#
# Requires: `gh` authenticated for the target repo. Prints only the
# number on stdout (so callers can capture it with `$(…)`); diagnostics
# go to stderr.
