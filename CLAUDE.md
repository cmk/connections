# CLAUDE.md

## What this repo is

A Rust library encoding Galois connections as first-class values, with
a hierarchy of lattice structures built on top. Port of the Haskell
[connections](https://github.com/cmk/connections) library.

## Parallel work

At the start of each conversation, ask the user:
"Are any other Claude instances working in this repo right now?"

If yes (or if the user says "work in a worktree"), create a git worktree
before making any changes:

```zsh
git worktree add ../project-<task> -b <branch>
```

Never run two Claude instances in the same worktree — cargo target-dir
locks and fd contention will break one or both sessions.

## Architecture

See `doc/design.md` for the full design rationale.

### Layout

```
Cargo.toml              — single crate
src/                    — library source
doc/                    — design docs, notes, plans
```

## Repository conventions

- **Each commit must leave the repo in a state where `cargo test` passes.**
  Do not commit a library module without the tests that cover it in the
  same commit. Never commit a red test suite.
- **No merge commits.** Always rebase onto main — never `git merge`. The
  history must be linear.
- **No unsafe code**: `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` when possible.
- **Test fixtures are gitignored**, and a fresh checkout must pass
  `cargo test --workspace` with zero setup. Tests that depend on a
  fixture file must use the `fixture_or_skip!` macro from the core
  crate and `return` cleanly when the fixture is absent — **do not**
  `#[ignore]` them and do not panic.
- **Property-based testing is mandatory** for any module that parses,
  encodes, or transforms data. Use `proptest` (workspace dev-dep).
  - Define strategies as functions returning `impl Strategy`, not
    `Arbitrary` derive. Use `prop_oneof!` with frequency weights to
    bias toward boundary values and edge cases.
  - Strategies shared across crates live in `crates/core/src/arb.rs`.
    Strategies local to one module stay colocated in that module's
    `#[cfg(test)]` block.
  - Properties that must hold for a sprint to ship are defined **in
    the plan's Verification table** before any code is written.
  - If a property test blocks progress during implementation, you may
    `#[ignore]` it temporarily **but you must document it** in the
    plan's Review section with the reason and a plan to re-enable.

### Session notes

Session notes live in `doc/notes/note-YYYY-MM-DD-nn.md`. The final field
`nn` is a counter that resets to 01 each day.

When the user says "print to notes", append the requested responses to
the current day's notes file in markdown format. Create the file if it
doesn't exist.

### Commit style

Conventional commits, present-tense imperative subject:

```
feat: Add parser for widget format
fix: Handle timeout on reconnect
test: Add round-trip property tests for codec
doc: Append Sprint 2 completion report
task: Add serde to core dependencies
```

Keep subjects under 72 characters. Use the body for non-obvious decisions.

## TDD workflow

Every sprint follows this order:

1. Write the plan to `doc/plans/plan-YYYY-MM-DD-nn.md` before touching source.
   The plan's **Verification** table must list the property tests that
   must pass for the sprint to ship (e.g., "message round-trips through
   encode/decode", "parser never panics on arbitrary input").
2. Create a worktree and branch for the sprint:
   `git worktree add ../project-<sprint> -b sprint/<name>`
3. Write proptest properties and test skeletons that compile but
   trivially fail. Properties come first — they define the contract.
4. Implement the module until all tests are green.
5. Commit on the branch, when green.
6. Run `/sprint-review` against the branch before merging.
7. Rebase onto main: `git rebase main` then fast-forward main.
8. Clean up: `git worktree remove ../project-<sprint>`.
9. Append deferred/review sections to the plan document. If any
   property tests were `#[ignore]`d during implementation, document
   the reason and the re-enablement plan here.

### Pre-commit hook

A Claude Code hook in `.claude/settings.json` runs `cargo test` and
`cargo clippy` before every `git commit` tool call. If either fails,
the commit is blocked. This is the automated quality gate; `/sprint-review`
is the manual one.

## Sprint plan format

```markdown
# Plan NN — Title

## Goal
One sentence.

## Dependency Graph
ASCII art showing task dependencies (T1 → T2, T3 → T4, etc.)

## Tasks
Each task is T1, T2, etc. Each task section includes:
- Problem or motivation
- Solution / implementation approach
- Types or API surface

## Verification

### Properties (must pass)
Table of proptest property names, the module they live in, and the
invariant they assert. These are the contract — if a property can't
be satisfied, the sprint isn't done.

| Property | Module | Invariant |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| `msg_round_trips` | `crate_foo::codec` | encode then decode recovers original |

### Spot checks
Table of unit test names + specific assertions.

### Build gates
- cargo build — no errors
- cargo test — all pass (no `#[ignore]` without Review documentation)
- cargo clippy --all-targets — no errors
- End-to-end scenario description

## Deferred
What was intentionally left out and why.

## Review
- Any `#[ignore]`d properties: which ones, why, re-enablement plan
- Design deviations from the plan
- Recommendations
```
