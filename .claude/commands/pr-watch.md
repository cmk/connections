description: Poll a PR for new review comments; auto-address the trivially-clear ones, run the full /pr-reply flow, then push transient round fixups. Designed for /loop-driven automation (e.g., `/loop 10m /pr-watch 17`). Never merges — the user finalizes and merges manually.

# /pr-watch — Automated review-round driver

One tick of the polling loop: check for new reviewer activity, handle
the clear-cut items, leave everything else for the user, push the
round fixups, stop before merge.

Target PR: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Never merge.** The user reviews each PR before merging, and that's
the real safety gate. Pushing the round fixups so CI re-runs and the
PR shows the latest replies is a normal step in the loop — not a
risk worth gating on, since the user can always revert or push more
fixes before deciding to merge.
Before merge, the user runs `scripts/git_autosquash_finalize.sh` to
collapse transient fixups and rerun full gates.

Designed for `/loop 10m /pr-watch <N>` (or similar cadence). Each tick
runs one round or exits quickly with a heartbeat.

---

## Step 0: Preconditions (fail fast, no side effects)

### 0a. Determine the PR number

Use `$ARGUMENTS` if non-empty. Otherwise:
```
gh pr view --json number --jq .number
```
Abort if neither yields a number.

### 0b. On the right branch?

```
branch=$(git branch --show-current)
remote_branch=$(gh pr view <N> --json headRefName --jq .headRefName)
[ "$branch" = "$remote_branch" ] || abort
```

### 0c. Working tree clean?

`git status --porcelain` must be empty. If dirty, exit with a message —
a prior run may have left something mid-flight, or the user is working.
Do **not** touch it.

### 0d. Recover from a previous push failure

```
git fetch --quiet origin "$branch" || true
unpushed=$(git log "origin/$branch..HEAD" --oneline)
failed_head_file=".pr-watch/pr-<N>.push-failed-head"
head=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

If `unpushed` is non-empty, only auto-retry when
`.pr-watch/pr-<N>.push-failed-head` exists and equals the current
`HEAD`. That marker means the stranded local commit is the exact commit
whose push failed in an earlier `/pr-watch` tick. Without the marker, or
if it names a different SHA, exit with:
`paused at round_unpushed: unpushed commit is not a recorded pr-watch
push failure`.

When the marker matches, try one push to recover:

```
git push origin "$branch"
```

If the push succeeds, continue to Step 1 (the round is now
`gh_review`; subsequent activity is what we're polling for) and remove
the marker. If it fails again, rewrite the marker with the current
`HEAD` and exit with one line: `paused at round_unpushed: push failed
(<error>)`. Do not poll, do not fix, do not reply — surface the issue
and let the user investigate. The next loop tick will retry the same
recorded failed head.

## Step 1: Poll for new activity

```
scripts/pr_report.py reviews <N>
```

- If output is `PR #N: no new items (...)` → exit with a one-line
  heartbeat (`pr-watch: no new activity on PR #N`). Round is over.
- If output is `PR #N: appended K items -> <path>` → continue.

## Step 2: Triage the new items

Read the newly appended block in `doc/reviews/review-NNNNN.md`. For each
new top-level thread, classify it into exactly one bucket:

- **auto-fix** — reviewer's intent is unambiguous AND the change is
  local (one file, under ~20 lines), non-destructive (no API removal,
  no file deletion), and does not require cross-module reasoning.
  GitHub suggested-change blocks, Copilot-style inline fixes, clear
  "should be X" with X spelled out, typos, missing imports, doc
  corrections.
- **push-back** — suggestion conflicts with repo conventions (AGENTS.md),
  plan constraints, or is factually wrong. You can explain the
  disagreement in one sentence.
- **defer** — valid concern but out of scope for this PR (tracked as
  a follow-up).
- **ask** — architecture decision, subjective design call, or anything
  where you'd hesitate. Do **not** auto-fix. Do **not** auto-reply.
  Leave the thread untouched on GitHub; flag it in the final report.

**When in doubt, classify as ask.** A miscategorized auto-fix ships
wrong code; a miscategorized ask only delays a round by one loop tick
until the user resolves it.

Apply AGENTS.md's
[gardener rule](../../AGENTS.md#the-gardener-rule) during
triage. Labels such as "optional", "nit", "follow-up", suppressed, or
low-confidence do not lower the seriousness of a correct comment. Fix
small local items now; defer only when the fix is large, complex,
outside scope, or incorrect.

Track two counters for the commit step:

```
auto_fix_count=0
reply_count=0

# Increment as integers while classifying threads:
# auto-fix thread:
auto_fix_count=$((auto_fix_count + 1))
reply_count=$((reply_count + 1))

# push-back or defer thread:
reply_count=$((reply_count + 1))
```

## Step 3: Apply the auto-fix items (no commit yet)

For each **auto-fix** item:

1. Read the surrounding code so you understand the context, not just
   the line.
2. Make the edit. Stay strictly within the scope of the comment — no
   adjacent cleanup, no "while I'm here" changes.
3. If multiple auto-fix items touch the same file, batch the edits
   before running tests (faster feedback).

**Do not commit yet.** The whole round (code fix + replies + mirrored
doc) is committed in Step 4 as transient review-round commits. This
matches the FSM in `doc/workflow.md`: `items_pulled → round_unpushed`
is a single transition; there is no intermediate `fix_unpushed` state.

If no auto-fix items apply (all push-back / defer / ask), Step 4 may
only create the review-doc fixup.

## Step 4: Post replies, mirror, and commit the round fixups

For each **auto-fix**, **push-back**, and **defer** thread from Step 2,
compose a 1–3 sentence reply per the rules in
`.claude/commands/pr-reply.md` (acknowledge / push back / defer).
Skip **ask** threads entirely — they stay unreplied on GitHub.

Then:

```
# Post replies
for each thread: scripts/pr_reply.py <N> <in_reply_to_id> "<body>"

# Mirror replies back into the review doc
scripts/pr_report.py reviews <N>

# Mechanical code/test/product-doc fixes become implementation fixups.
git add -A ':!doc/reviews/*.md'
if ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
    git commit --fixup=<latest-implementation-commit>
    # Use standalone `fix:`/`feat:` only for design-changing feedback.
fi

# Mirrored review-doc changes become finalized-doc fixups.
git add doc/reviews/review-NNNNN.md
if ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
    git commit --fixup=<finalized-doc-commit>
fi
```

The pre-commit hook runs `cargo fmt --check`, `scripts/check_pii.sh`,
and `scripts/check_layers.sh`. The pre-push hook runs
`cargo test --workspace` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
If either fails:

- Read the failure. If a specific auto-fix caused the breakage, revert
  that one edit and reclassify the corresponding thread as
  **push-back** with an explanation. Retry `git commit`.
- If the commit fails twice: abort the round. Replies are already on
  GitHub (Step 4's post loop is destructive); leave the working tree
  dirty so the next loop tick exits at Step 0c and surfaces the issue
  to the user. Do not `git checkout --` — that would discard the
  fixes the replies reference.

If `pr_reply.py` fails partway through the post loop (network /
rate limit), abort before mirror+commit. Re-running this step is
clean: the next tick's Step 1 mirrors the already-posted replies, the
"unreplied threads" filter skips them, and the missing posts go
through. (Same as `/pr-reply`'s Recovery section.)

## Step 5: Push the round commits

If Step 4 produced commits (the working tree had staged changes —
either code edits or the mirrored reply doc), push them now:

```
git push origin "$branch"
```

This advances the branch to `gh_review` so CI re-runs against the
latest state and the reviewer (Copilot, the user) sees the replies
attached to the right tip. The user is still the merge gate — they
review the PR as a whole, run `scripts/git_autosquash_finalize.sh`,
then invoke `scripts/git_merge.sh`. Round fixups reaching origin
without their merge are the normal mid-PR state, not a risk to gate on.

If Step 4 produced no commit, skip this step. There is nothing to push.
That should now mean Step 1 had no doc delta and no replies/code edits
were produced; ask-only rounds with newly mirrored review comments
normally produce a `doc:` commit and are pushed.

If `git push` fails (network, auth, non-fast-forward because someone
else pushed), exit with the error and leave the round commits local.
Run `mkdir -p .pr-watch`, then record the failed `HEAD` in
`.pr-watch/pr-<N>.push-failed-head` before exiting so the next tick's
Step 0d can retry only that exact stranded round tip.

**Never merge.** Finalization and merge are manual user steps.

## Step 6: Report

Print a structured summary, ≤ 15 lines. The heading names the FSM
state from `doc/workflow.md` so the read-out reflects what's actually
true on the wire.

If Step 5 pushed commits:

```
pr-watch PR #<N> — round complete at gh_review (commits pushed)
  auto-fixed:  <count>   (e.g., "unused import, typo in doc")
  pushed-back: <count>   (e.g., "proposed rename conflicts with crate boundary")
  deferred:    <count>
  needs you:   <count>   ← these stay open; read them
    - path:line — one-line summary
    - path:line — one-line summary
  round commits: <sha...> (pushed — transient fixups or standalone fix/feat)
  next step:    wait for CI + Copilot re-review, then finalize with
                `scripts/git_autosquash_finalize.sh` and merge with
                `scripts/git_merge.sh` when ready.
```

If Step 4 produced no commit:

```
pr-watch PR #<N> — round complete at gh_review (no commit needed)
  auto-fixed:  0
  pushed-back: 0
  deferred:    0
  needs you:   <count>
    - path:line — one-line summary
  round commits: none — no staged code, replies, or review-doc delta
  next step:   PR is mergeable when reviewers stop posting.
```

If Step 5's `git push` failed:

```
pr-watch PR #<N> — paused at round_unpushed (push failed)
  auto-fixed:  <count>
  ...
  round commits: <sha...> (LOCAL ONLY — push failed: <error>)
  next step:   investigate the push failure, then `git push` manually.
```

Do not start another round synchronously.

## Step 7: Schedule the next tick (or quit)

This command is designed for `/loop /pr-watch <N>` **without an
interval** — dynamic/self-paced mode — so the schedule below actually
takes effect. If invoked with a fixed `/loop 10m …`, the runtime
overrides the schedule; see "Fixed vs. dynamic" below.

### Backoff schedule

```
BACKOFF_MINUTES=(5 5 5 10 10)   # quit on the 6th quiet tick (after the 5 slots are exhausted)
```

State is a single integer in `.pr-watch/pr-<N>.count` (gitignored,
created on first use). It counts consecutive **unproductive** ticks —
ticks that exited at Step 0d (push_failed, after recovery push also
failed), Step 1 (no new activity), or Step 4 with nothing posted.
Any tick that addressed activity (and pushed successfully) resets
the counter to 0.

Push-failure recovery uses a separate
`.pr-watch/pr-<N>.push-failed-head` marker containing the exact failed
commit SHA. Remove it after a successful recovery push or successful
Step 5 push.

### Decision

Read the counter (default 0 if the file doesn't exist):

```
count=$(cat .pr-watch/pr-<N>.count 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
```

Classify this tick's outcome:
- **activity** — Step 2 triage saw new items, any bucket (even if all
  were ask/push-back): `new=0`
- **unproductive** — early-exit at Step 0d, or Step 1's "no new items":
  `new=$((count + 1))`

Then decide the next action:

```
BACKOFF_MINUTES=(5 5 5 10 10)
N_SLOTS=${#BACKOFF_MINUTES[@]}     # 5

if [ "$new" -gt "$N_SLOTS" ]; then
  # Out of schedule. End the loop.
  rm -f ".pr-watch/pr-<N>.count"
  echo "loop ending: $((N_SLOTS + 1)) consecutive quiet ticks (backoff exhausted after $(( 5+5+5+10+10 ))min)"
  # DO NOT call ScheduleWakeup.
else
  if [ "$new" -eq 0 ]; then
    delay_min=${BACKOFF_MINUTES[0]}      # post-activity: back to 5m
  else
    delay_min=${BACKOFF_MINUTES[$((new - 1))]}
  fi
  mkdir -p .pr-watch
  echo "$new" > ".pr-watch/pr-<N>.count"
  # Call ScheduleWakeup:
  #   delaySeconds = delay_min * 60
  #   prompt       = "/pr-watch <N>"
  #   reason       = concise status, e.g.:
  #                  "PR #<N> quiet <new>/<N_SLOTS>, next in <delay_min>min"
  #                  or "PR #<N> addressed <K> comments, next in 5min"
fi
```

Then emit the `ScheduleWakeup` tool call (if not quitting).

### Resulting cadence

Assuming no activity from the moment of `/loop /pr-watch <N>`:

| Tick | Elapsed | Outcome     | Next wait |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 0    | 0m      | quiet       | 5m        |
| 1    | 5m      | quiet       | 5m        |
| 2    | 10m     | quiet       | 5m        |
| 3    | 15m     | quiet       | 10m       |
| 4    | 25m     | quiet       | 10m       |
| 5    | 35m     | quiet       | **quit**  |

Any activity tick resets the counter to 0, so a burst mid-backoff
restores the 5-minute cadence. The 35-minute ceiling is a cap on
"total silence before I go home"; it does not cap how long the loop
can run if reviewers are active.

### Fixed vs. dynamic

- `/loop /pr-watch <N>` — **dynamic**, backoff+quit as above.
  Recommended for Copilot-on-push rounds where silence means "review
  is done, go home."
- `/loop 5m /pr-watch <N>` — fixed 5m, no backoff, no auto-quit.
  Use if you want the loop to run indefinitely until you kill it
  (e.g., waiting on a slow human reviewer).
- `/loop 10m /pr-watch <N>` — fixed 10m. Same as above, lazier cadence.
