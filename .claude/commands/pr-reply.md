description: Finalize a PR review round before push. Apply fix edits to the working tree first, then run this command — it posts replies, mirrors them back into review-NNNNN.md via scripts/pr_report.py reviews, and produces transient fixup commits by default. One push delivers the whole round. Refuses to run if the branch already has unpushed commits from another round.

# /pr-reply — Finalize a PR Round (Before Push)

Apply fix edits to the working tree, then run this command. It posts
replies to each unresolved PR review thread, mirrors them back into
`doc/reviews/review-NNNNN.md`, and produces the round's transient
commits. Stops before `git push` — the user runs that explicitly as
the last step, so one push delivers code + replies + review doc.

This ordering — **fix-edits (uncommitted) → reply → mirror → fixup
commit(s) → push** — is deliberate. Mechanical code/test/product-doc
fixes become `fixup!` commits against the implementation commit they
repair, and review-doc mirror changes become a separate `fixup!`
against the finalized-doc commit. Design-changing feedback may remain
as a standalone `fix:` or `feat:` commit.

Target PR: `$ARGUMENTS`

---

## Step 0: Preconditions (bail before posting anything)

Posting replies is destructive — they hit GitHub immediately and can't
be un-posted. Validate upfront; do not proceed past this step if any
check fails.

### 0a. Determine the PR number

If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, use it. Otherwise fall back to the
current branch's open PR:

```
gh pr view --json number --jq .number
```

Abort if neither yields a number.

### 0b. Branch must be at `gh_review` (no unpushed commits)

Per `doc/workflow.md`, this command runs on the
`gh_review → items_pulled → round_unpushed` arrow — starting from
`gh_review`, which means the local branch is at-or-behind origin.
A pre-existing unpushed commit means a previous round didn't push,
and bundling another round on top would produce a two-commit round
that's harder to bisect and doesn't fit the FSM.

```
branch=$(git branch --show-current)
git fetch --quiet origin "$branch" || true
unpushed=$(git log "origin/$branch..HEAD" --oneline)
```

- If `unpushed` is non-empty: **refuse**. Print:
  > Branch '$branch' has unpushed commits. Per doc/workflow.md, a new
    > review round starts from `gh_review` — push the existing
    > transient round first (`git push`), then re-run `/pr-reply`.

  Do not post replies.

### 0c. Working tree sanity

Run `git status`. The working tree may be **dirty with the round's fix
edits** — that's expected and is exactly what this command bundles
into the round commits. No constraint on which paths can be dirty;
trust the user not to bundle unrelated changes. The pre-commit hook
(Step 6) will catch test/clippy/PII regressions.

If the working tree is **clean**, this is a no-op-code round (all
push-back / defer). Proceed normally — the round may only create a
review-doc fixup containing the mirrored reply doc, which is fine and
does not break the FSM.

## Step 1: Refresh the review doc before deciding what to reply to

Even though we'll run `pr_report.py reviews` again in Step 5 to mirror our
own replies, run it **first** so the "unreplied threads" analysis is
against the latest GitHub state and so partial-failure recovery
(see Recovery section below) works correctly:

```
scripts/pr_report.py reviews <N>
```

If the script reports new items, read them — a reviewer may have
posted push-back or new findings since the last round, which changes
which threads you should reply to and what the replies should say.

## Step 2: Identify unreplied threads

Read `doc/reviews/review-NNNNN.md`. A **thread** is a top-level inline
comment header plus any replies underneath it, terminating at the next
`### ` or end of file. Thread headers look like:

- `### {user} on [\`{path}\`](...)` (file-level or outdated-diff comments
  where the GitHub API returned `line: null`)
- `### {user} on [\`{path}:{line}\`](...)` (normal inline comments)

A thread is **unreplied** if no `↳` reply in it is authored by a non-bot
account — i.e., not `Copilot`, not `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`,
not `claude[bot]`. A bot replying to its own comment does not close the
thread.

Skip top-level review-body sections (`### {user} — {state}` with no `on
[\`path\`]`) — they don't take threaded replies via the review-comment
API.

## Step 3: Compose replies

For each unreplied thread, write 1–3 sentences that do exactly one of:

- **Acknowledge a fix**: name what changed. Example: `Fixed — switched
  to set-membership de-dup per your suggestion.` Citing the eventual
  round commit SHA is fine but optional (you don't have it yet at this
  step); naming the change is what matters.
- **Accept as follow-up**: explain the deferral and where it's tracked.
  Example: `Deferred — tracked as a follow-up in the PR description.
  Not blocking this change.`
- **Push back with reasoning**: in one sentence, no hedging. Example:
  `The existing behavior is intentional: callers downstream depend on
  the current return shape.`

Rules:
- Don't thank the reviewer. Don't apologize. Don't repeat the comment.
- Don't post a reply that just says "done" — name what was done.
- One reply per thread, not per comment. If a thread already has a
  human-authored reply buried, don't post another.
- Apply AGENTS.md's
  [gardener rule](../../AGENTS.md#the-gardener-rule):
  "optional", "follow-up", suppressed, and low-confidence comments are
  real review input. Fix small correct items now; defer only when they
  are large, complex, outside scope, or incorrect, and say why.

## Step 4: Post the replies

For each composed reply:

```
scripts/pr_reply.py <PR> <in_reply_to_id> "<body>"
```

`<in_reply_to_id>` is the `gh-id` from the top-level comment's
`<!-- gh-id: NNNNN -->` marker in the review file. Pass `-` as the
body to read from stdin for long or multi-line replies:

```
scripts/pr_reply.py 5 3098547699 - <<'EOF'
Fixed — ...
EOF
```

If any post fails (network, rate limit, auth): **abort before mirror
and commit**. The working tree still has the uncommitted code edits.
See the Recovery section for the re-run shape — it's clean because
Step 1 + Step 2's filter dedupes already-posted threads.

## Step 5: Mirror the replies back into the review doc

```
scripts/pr_report.py reviews <N>
```

The script appends the replies you just posted (plus anything else new)
to `review-NNNNN.md` via set-membership de-dup — safe to re-run.

## Step 6: Transient round commits

Commit staged changes, but **only if there are changes** — an all-`ask`
round with no doc delta produces nothing to commit. Keep review-doc
mirror changes separate from implementation fixups so autosquash never
moves them before the commit that creates `doc/reviews/review-NNNNN.md`:

```
# Commit non-review-doc changes first.
git add -A ':!doc/reviews/*.md'
if ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
    # Mechanical default:
    git commit --fixup=<latest-implementation-commit>
    # If the feedback changes design/behavior, use a standalone
    # `fix:` or `feat:` commit instead.
fi

# Commit mirrored review-doc changes as their own doc fixup.
git add doc/reviews/review-NNNNN.md
if ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
    git commit --fixup=<finalized-doc-commit>
fi
```

The pre-commit hook runs `cargo fmt --check`, `scripts/check_pii.sh`,
and `scripts/check_readme_mirror.sh`. The pre-push hook runs
`cargo test --features fixed,time,hifi,testing,macros`,
`cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and a `cargo doc` with
`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings`. If any of these fails:

- Read the failure. Fix the code or revert the offending edit.
- Retry `git commit` — staging is preserved.
- Replies are already on GitHub (Step 4 succeeded). Don't try to
  un-post; just commit when ready.

There is no `--amend` step. The commits either succeed (whole round
captured, state advances to `round_unpushed`) or:

- The pre-commit hook fails: working tree still dirty, replies on
  GitHub but no mirror committed yet — re-run `/pr-reply` to
  redo Step 5+6.
- Nothing was staged: branch stays at `gh_review`. No state change.

## Step 7: Report and hand off to the user

Print a one-paragraph summary that **names the FSM state from
`doc/workflow.md`** so the read-out reflects what's actually true on
the wire. Two terminal shapes:

**If Step 6 made commits:**

- Number of threads replied to
- Round commit SHAs
- **State:** `round_unpushed` (mid-cycle, NOT mergeable). The merge
  transition requires push, then `scripts/git_autosquash_finalize.sh`.
- **Next step for the user:** `git push` (or `git push -u origin
  <branch>` if this is the first push for the branch). Before merge,
  run `scripts/git_autosquash_finalize.sh`. Then merge via
  `scripts/git_merge.sh <pr-args>` rather than `gh pr merge` — the
  wrapper refuses to invoke the merge while the local branch is ahead
  of origin or still contains autosquashable commits.

**If Step 6 made no commit** (all-`ask` round or every reply was
already a duplicate of an existing one — no code delta, no doc
delta):

- Number of threads replied to (may be zero)
- "No commit — nothing staged after Step 5"
- **State:** `gh_review` (no change — branch is exactly where it
  started). Mergeable when reviewers stop posting.
- **Next step for the user:** read the review file for any `ask`
  threads that need their judgment.

Do **not** push. The user runs the push explicitly as the last step.

## Recovery: partial reply-post failure

If `scripts/pr_reply.py` fails partway through Step 4, abort the
run before Step 5. Working tree has the code edits but no mirrored
replies. Some replies are on GitHub, some aren't. Re-run
`/pr-reply`:

1. Step 1's `pr_report.py reviews` mirrors the already-posted replies into
   the doc.
2. Step 2's "unreplied threads" filter skips threads that now have
   `↳ {user}` mirrored replies — only the unposted threads remain.
3. Steps 3–5 cover the missing posts and re-mirror.
4. Step 6 commits the transient round fixups.

`pr_reply.py` is **not** idempotent server-side — calling it twice
with the same `in_reply_to_id` posts twice. Idempotency comes from
the Step 1 mirror happening *before* Step 2's filter; don't bypass
Step 1 on retry.

## Recovery: pre-commit hook fails in Step 6

Replies are on GitHub. Working tree has code edits + mirrored doc,
all uncommitted. Fix the test/clippy/PII issue, then either:

- **`git commit` manually**: use the same fixup target. The pre-commit
  hook re-runs.
- **Re-run `/pr-reply`**: Step 0b sees no unpushed commits, Step
  1+2 see no unreplied threads (all already mirrored), Steps 3–5 are
  no-ops, Step 6 retries the commit.

Both paths converge on the same `round_unpushed` state.

## Notes

- **Bots don't count as human replies.** A Copilot `↳ Copilot` reply
  under its own comment doesn't satisfy "replied". Only a human-
  authored reply closes the thread.
- **One reply per thread, not per comment.** If a thread already has
  a human reply, don't post another.
- **The whole round is one push.** Mechanical code fixes and review-doc
  mirrors are separate fixups when both exist, pushed together, then
  collapsed by `scripts/git_autosquash_finalize.sh` before merge.
