# MR !00000 — placeholder

This file is a deliberate sentinel, not a real review. **Do not delete
it. Do not write review content into it.**

GitLab numbers merge request iids starting at **1**, so `review-00000.md`
will never correspond to an actual MR. The file exists to reserve the
`00000` slot and pre-empt two recurring agent mistakes:

1. **Inventing a placeholder filename.** `/sprint-review` names review
   files `review-NNNNN.md` from the start, computing `NNNNN` via
   `scripts/next_mr_number.sh` before the MR is opened (the script
   queries the project's highest MR iid via `glab api` and adds one).
   Without a visible `review-NNNNN.md` in the directory, an agent that
   doesn't find the script might invent an ad-hoc name like
   `review-draft.md` or `review-pending.md` instead of running it.
   This file exists so the convention is visibly anchored.

2. **Off-by-one numbering on the first real review.** The first MR in
   a project is `!1`, not `!0`. An agent skimming the directory for
   the highest-numbered file and adding one would pick `00001`
   correctly; one skimming for "the next slot" and assuming `00000` is
   unused would collide with this file. Keeping `review-00000.md`
   present makes the convention explicit: `00000` is reserved, real
   reviews start at `00001`.
